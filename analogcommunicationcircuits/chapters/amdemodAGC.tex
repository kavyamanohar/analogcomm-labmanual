\chapter[AM Detection with Automatic Gain Control]{AM Detection with Automatic Gain Control}
\section*{Aim}
To demodulate the message content from AM signal. Also detect the automatic gain control signal from the received AM signal.
\section*{Theory}
A simple AM demodulator is a diode envelope detector as discussed in  Chapter \ref{AMDetection}.
\section*{Design}Afrte the envelope detector, aproperly designed low wpass filter is added to filter out the high frequency carrier and to ontain the low frequency modulating signal. This signal contains a dc level also which can be used for automatic Gain Control (AGC) for the IF amplifier stages of a superhetrodyne receiver.
